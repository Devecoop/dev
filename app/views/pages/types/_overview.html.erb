<h2 id="types-api-what">What is a Type?</a></h2>

<p>
A type describes the structure of a device. In its simplest form every type can be defined
as the combination of three key elements.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Properties</em> - what vary during time.</li>
  <li><em>Functions</em> - what a device can do.</li>
  <li><em>Statuses</em> - what a device is in a specific time of its life.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
  <span class="label label-lelylan">notice</span>
  Types are key concepts in Lelylan. When connecting a physical device you need to checkout
  the property IDs to undestand all requests coming from Lelylan and to send back the correct
  information.

<p>
Here an example describing a simplified dimmer type.
</p>

<table class="table table-stripped table-hover">
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Properties</td><td>status, intensity</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Functions</td><td>turn on, turn off, set intensity</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Statuses</td><td>light on, light off</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
The simplest way to use the Types API is to use <a href="http://types.lelylan.com">Lelylan Types</a>.
It gives you everything you need to find, define and discuss any device structure in an open
and collaborative way.

<h2 id="types-api-learn">Do I really need to learn the Types API?</h2>

<p>
No. If all you need is to search or define a device type just use
<a href="http://types.lelylan.com">Lelylan Types</a>.
But, if you are curious to fully understand how a type is defined, this is the right place
where to start. It can be a little tricky to get started with types because of its complex
JSON representation. To make it easier to get, think at the JSON as the composition of three resources:
properties, functions and statuses.
