            <h4>Understanding Lelylan</h4>

          <div class="bs-docs-section">

            <h2 id="overview-what-is-lelylan">What is Lelylan</h2>

            <p>
              Lelylan is a simple and open API to build the Connected Home where makers can
              focus on the hardware and on the design process, while developers create new
              apps for the web, the mobile and much more.
            </p>

            <h2 id="overview-how-does-it-work">How does it work</h2>

            <p>
              Any request sent to the Lelylan API is forwarded the the physical device, which
              is in charge of applying the desired changes and of sending back a message to
              Lelylan when those are made.
            </p>

            <p>
              Take a look at this request flow to better understand the most important steps.
            </p>

            <%= render 'shared/animations/lelylan' %>

            <h2 id="overview-resources">Resources</h2>

            <p>
              Lelylan is based on three resources. Just grasp the general concept behind them
              and don't warry if something is not clear, we'll come back later on them.
            </p>

            <h3>Devices</h3>

            <p>
              A Device is a resource virtually representing
              everything you interact with everyday of your life. You interact with lights,
              appliances, alarms, cooling and heating systems, gas sensors, rolling
              shutters, windows, irrigations, video surveillance, gates, multimedia (audio and
              video) and much more. With a Device you can simulate, monitor and
              control any of those devices through a unique URI.
            </p>

            <h3>Physicals</h3>

            <p>
            Whereas Devices are a virtual representation, Physicals are the real objects
            you interact with everyday of your life. To enable the communication between Lelylan
            and the physical world, the physical device must be able to connect to the Internet
            and to implement the Physical API.
            <p>

            <h3>Types</h3>

            <p>
            A Type describes the structure of a device. Lelylan has started to define the most
            used ones, but anyone, can create new ones. In its simplest form every Type can be
            defined as the combination of three key elements.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Properties</strong> - what vary during time.</li>
              <li><strong>Functions</strong> - what a device can do.</li>
              <li><strong>Statuses</strong> - what a device is in a specific time of its life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="overview-next">What's next</h2>

            <p>
              It's time to try Lelylan out.
